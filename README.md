Daily programmer challenge #375 [Easy]

This is a challenge posted to r/dailyprogrammer. I have completed both the challenge and the bonus which means I did not convert the number at any point in order to iterate through it. I have completed this challenge in both C and Java as they are fairly similar solutions. Below is a description of the challenge with a link to the reddit post.

Description:
A number is input in computer then a new one should get printed by adding one to each of its digit. If you encounter a 9, insert a 10 (don't carry over, just shift things around).
For example, 998 becomes 10109.

Bonus:
This challenge is trivial to do if you map it to a string to iterate over the input, operate, and then cast it back. Instead, try doing it without casting it as a string at any point, keep it numeric (int, float if you need it) only.
